                <p>After individual pieces of content are scored, the system calculates a final <strong>Risk
                        Score</strong> for posts, comments, and users. This score is used for sorting and review in the
                    administrative dashboard.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-4">Rule 2.1: Post & Comment Risk Score</h5>
                <p>The Risk Score for an individual post or comment is determined by its Content Score, adjusted for the

                            <li>If account age is less than 7 days, <code>risk_score = base_score * 1.5</code>.</li>

                <h5 class="mt-4">Rule 2.2: User Risk Score</h5>
                <p>The Risk Score for a user is a weighted average of their content, designed to reflect their overall

                        the user has no posts, this value is 0.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Step 3 (Comment Score):</strong> Calculate the Content Score for

                        <code>content_risk_score</code> is calculated using the following formula:

                        <code>user_risk_score</code> is determined by applying a multiplier to the
                        <code>content_risk_score</code> based on account age:
                        <ul>

                            <li>If account age < 30 days: <code>user_risk_score = content_risk_score * 1.2</code></li>
                            <li>Otherwise: <code>user_risk_score = content_risk_score</code></li>

                        <code>user_risk_score</code> is capped at a maximum value of <strong>5.0</strong>.</li>
